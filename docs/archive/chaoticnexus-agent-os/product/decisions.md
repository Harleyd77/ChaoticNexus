# Key Decisions & Architecture

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Framework Choice: Flask over Django
**Decision**: Use Flask instead of Django for the web framework
**Date**: Initial development (v1.0)
**Rationale**:
- Flask provides more flexibility and lighter footprint
- Easier to customize for specific business needs
- Simpler learning curve for the development team
- Better suited for API-first approach if needed in future
**Trade-offs**:
- Less built-in admin interface (custom solution needed)
- Manual configuration of many components
- Requires more explicit setup for production deployment

### Database: PostgreSQL over SQLite
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for production
**Date**: v1.2 migration
**Rationale**:
- Better concurrency handling for multiple users
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Advanced features like JSON fields, arrays, full-text search
- Better performance for complex queries
- Professional data management capabilities
**Trade-offs**:
- Requires separate database server setup
- More complex deployment configuration
- Higher resource usage

### ORM: SQLAlchemy over Raw SQL
**Decision**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
**Date**: Initial development
**Rationale**:
- Type safety and reduced SQL injection risks
- Database-agnostic development
- Automatic query optimization and caching
- Easier testing with mocked database sessions
- Better maintainability with model definitions
**Trade-offs**:
- Learning curve for complex queries
- Potential performance overhead (mitigated with proper usage)
- Less control over exact SQL generation

## Architecture Decisions

### Application Structure: Blueprint Pattern
**Decision**: Organize application using Flask Blueprints
**Date**: Initial development
**Rationale**:
- Modular organization by feature areas
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Easier testing of individual components
- Scalable for team development
- Clear separation of concerns
**Trade-offs**:
- Slightly more complex routing setup
- Requires understanding of Flask application factory pattern

### Data Persistence: Repository Pattern
**Decision**: Implement repository pattern for data access
**Date**: v1.3 refactoring
**Rationale**:
- Centralize data access logic
- Easier testing and mocking
- Consistent interface for database operations
- Better separation of business logic from data access
- Simplified future migrations to different storage systems
**Trade-offs**:
- Additional layer of abstraction
- Potential performance overhead (minimal with proper implementation)

### Error Handling: Custom Error Pages
**Decision**: Implement custom error handlers with user-friendly pages
**Date**: v1.3
**Rationale**:
- Better user experience during errors
- Consistent error reporting and logging
- Easier debugging and issue tracking
- Professional appearance for production users
**Trade-offs**:
- Additional template and styling work
- More complex error handling setup

## Development Workflow Decisions

### Code Style: PEP 8 with Extensions
**Decision**: Follow PEP 8 with additional team-specific rules
**Date**: Initial development
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Python code
- Better readability and maintainability
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Consistent code formatting
- Reduced cognitive load in code reviews
**Trade-offs**:
- Strict formatting rules may slow initial development
- Requires tooling setup (black, flake8, etc.)

### Testing Strategy: Unit Tests First
**Decision**: Prioritize unit tests over integration tests initially
**Date**: v1.3
**Rationale**:
- Faster feedback during development
- Easier to test business logic in isolation
- Better refactoring safety
- Foundation for integration tests later
- Encourages better code design (dependency injection)
**Trade-offs**:
- May miss integration issues early
- Requires more mocking setup
- Database tests can be slower to run

### Deployment: Docker-based
**Decision**: Use Docker for development and deployment
**Date**: Initial development
**Rationale**:
- Consistent environments across development and production
- Simplified dependency management
- Easier scaling and deployment
- Isolated application environment
- Version control for infrastructure
**Trade-offs**:
- Learning curve for Docker concepts
- More complex local development setup
- Resource overhead in development

## Security Decisions

### Authentication: Session-based
**Decision**: Use Flask-Login with session-based authentication
**Date**: v1.3
**Rationale**:
- Simple and secure for web applications
- Built-in session management
- Integration with existing user system
- Industry standard approach
- Good balance of security and usability
**Trade-offs**:
- Server-side session storage requirements
- Potential scaling challenges (resolved with proper session handling)

### Password Security: Werkzeug
**Decision**: Use Werkzeug's security module for password hashing
**Date**: Initial development
**Rationale**:
- Built-in to Flask ecosystem
- Industry standard security practices
- Automatic algorithm updates
- No need for external dependencies
- Proven security track record
**Trade-offs**:
- Tied to Werkzeug's implementation
- Less flexibility for custom security requirements

## Future Considerations

### Potential Architecture Changes
- **Microservices**: If the application grows significantly, consider breaking into services
- **API-first**: Develop comprehensive REST API for mobile/web client flexibility
- **Event-driven**: Implement event system for better decoupling of components
- **Caching Layer**: Add Redis or similar for performance optimization

### Scalability Decisions
- **Database Sharding**: Plan for horizontal scaling if user base grows significantly
- **CDN Integration**: For static assets and media files
- **Background Jobs**: Implement queue system for long-running tasks
- **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring stack

### Team and Process Decisions
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory for all changes to maintain quality
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Documentation**: Living documentation that stays current
- **Retrospectives**: Regular process improvement discussions

## Decision Review Process

All major decisions should be:
1. **Documented** with clear rationale and trade-offs
2. **Reviewed** by relevant team members
3. **Re-evaluated** periodically as context changes
4. **Updated** when new information becomes available

This ensures decisions remain relevant and the team maintains awareness of why certain approaches were chosen.
