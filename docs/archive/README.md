# Archived Documentation

This folder holds legacy instructions and summaries that were superseded by the current documentation set.

## Contents

- `ChaoticNexus-Orig/` – original Agent OS instruction set; kept for reference but not part of the active workflow.
- `legacy/analysis/` – historical migration notes and templates from earlier phases.
- `docs.plan.md` – October 2025 documentation simplification plan; superseded by `docs/project-overview.md` and `docs/current-focus.md`.
- Any future docs retired from the main `docs/` index should move here with a short note.

## When To Use

- Only consult these files if you need background on past automation runs or experiments.
- For current project context, start with `docs/project-overview.md` and `docs/current-focus.md`.
