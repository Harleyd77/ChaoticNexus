# Documentation Simplification Plan

## Steps

1. **Inventory Existing Guidance** ✅
- Reviewed key instruction/summary files and archived outdated reports (e.g., `MIGRATION_STATUS.md`, `OVERNIGHT_SUMMARY.md`) into `docs/archive/`.
- Captured remaining active references and where they now live.

2. **Draft Project Overview** ✅
- Authored `docs/project-overview.md` summarizing mission, personas, architecture, and entry points.
- Highlighted canonical docs for dashboards, intake flows, and supporting systems.

3. **Establish Working Plan Doc** ✅
- Created `docs/current-focus.md` with active goals, weekly priorities, and logging instructions.
- Wired documentation logging script so updates persist session-to-session.

4. **Consolidate or Archive Legacy Docs** ✅
- Migrated historical guidance into `docs/archive/` with a README index.
- Cross-linked specialized guides (e.g., button roadmap) back to the overview/current-focus pair.

## Status

- [x] Audit existing instruction/summary files and decide keep vs archive
- [x] Create docs/project-overview.md with goals, audiences, architecture
- [x] Create docs/current-focus.md with active priorities and maintenance process
- [x] Update or archive redundant instruction documents and document locations
