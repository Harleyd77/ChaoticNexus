# Current Focus

_Last updated: October 15, 2025_

## Active Goals

- Align documentation so Cursor sessions share the same context without re-explaining the project.
- Decide which dashboards stay primary (Flask vs. React SPA) and document the rationale.
- Prepare the codebase for gradual UI consistency work (button system, layout polish) without carrying extra baggage.

## This Week’s Priorities

1. Finalize the project overview and reference docs (this pass).
2. Evaluate redundant dashboards and plan consolidation steps.
3. Kick off the unified button utility rollout once documentation is stable.

## How To Use This Doc

- Update the “Last updated” line whenever priorities change.
- Keep the goals short; link out to issue trackers or TODO lists for granular tasks.
- When a focus item completes, move it to the “Recently Completed” list with a short note (run `python tools/log_focus_update.py "summary"` to auto-log).
