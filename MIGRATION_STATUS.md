## üìù Notes for Testing

**Window 2 (Chrome DevTools MCP):**
- All pages listed above are now browsable
- Admin job/customer forms persist changes; other forms still read-only
- Look for layout issues, broken CSS, console errors
- Test mobile responsive views
- Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, focus states)

**Known Limitations:**
- No database connectivity yet - all pages show placeholder/sample data
- Forms POST but don't persist (need repository layer)
- Some complex JavaScript from legacy not yet migrated (customers.js, etc.)
- Theme toggle in header may need adjustment for customer portal nav
