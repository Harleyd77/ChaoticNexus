Drop manufacturer logo PNGs here and they will appear on each powder card.

Naming convention (case-insensitive, non-alphanumerics → dashes):

  {slug}.png

Where slug is computed from the manufacturer string, e.g.:
- "Tiger"           → tiger.png
- "Tiger Drylac"    → tiger-drylac.png
- "Prismatic Powders" → prismatic-powders.png

Recommended size: ~160×50px (transparent background). The UI renders at ~22px tall.

Tip: You can also upload SVGs, but name them {slug}.png or adjust the template.
