# Customer Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive customer management system with quick-reference cards, expandable mini-dashboards, and a safe edit flow for the PowderApp1.3-dev project. The system follows modern UX patterns with view/locked states, lazy loading, and navigation guards.

## Files Created

### 1. **Service Layer**
#### `/src/powder_app/services/__init__.py`
- Empty init file for services package

#### `/src/powder_app/services/customers_service.py` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Data access and KPI aggregation layer
- **Key Functions**:
  - `get_customers_summary()` - Returns customer list with job stats (Active, Queued, Completed)
  - `get_customer_dashboard(customer_id)` - Returns comprehensive dashboard with KPIs, work mix, and activity
  - `update_customer(customer_id, data)` - Handles partial customer updates from edit mode
- **KPIs Calculated**:
  - Active jobs count
  - Average turnaround (last 10 completed jobs)
  - On-time percentage (90 days)
  - Jobs this month
  - Redo count (12 months)
  - Job type distribution (6 months)
  - Top 3 powder colors
  - Recent jobs (5 most recent)

### 2. **Templates**
#### `/src/powder_app/templates/customers/index.html` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Customer list page with expandable cards
- **Features**:
  - Collapsed cards showing company, contact, phone/email chips, job stats badges
  - Expandable mini-dashboard (lazy loaded via API)
  - Live search (client-side filtering)
  - New customer modal form
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Responsive: stacks to single column on mobile
  - Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space to expand)
- **No CSV export UI** (as specified)

#### `/src/powder_app/templates/customers/profile.html` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Full customer profile page with view/edit modes
- **Features**:
  - View/locked mode by default
  - Edit button toggles to edit mode (fields become inputs)
  - Save/Cancel buttons in edit mode
  - Navigation guard warns on unsaved changes
  - Sections: Essential Info, Address, Business Details, Recent Jobs
  - Quick Stats sidebar
  - Quick Actions (Create Job, View All Jobs)
  - Contacts list

  - Maintains expanded state until navigation
- **Performance**: Dashboard data only fetched when card is expanded

- **Features**:
  - Skeleton loading animation
  - Status badge styles (active, queued, completed)

## Files Modified

### 1. **Flask Blueprint**
#### `/src/powder_app/blueprints/customers.py`
**Changes**:
- **Imports**: Added `from ..services import customers_service`
- **Routes Modified**:
  - `GET /customers` - Now renders `customers/index.html` (simplified, data loaded via API)
- **Routes Added**:
  - `GET /api/customers` - Returns JSON summary list (used by JS)
  - `GET /api/customers/<id>/dashboard` - Returns JSON dashboard data (lazy loaded)
  - `PATCH /api/customers/<id>` - Updates customer with partial data (from edit mode)
  - `GET /customers/<id>` - Modified to render `customers/profile.html` with full job data
- **Authorization**: All API routes check `is_admin()` or `has_perm("see_customers")`
- **Data**: Jobs query now includes `date_in` and filters out archived jobs

---

## API Endpoints

  "contact_name": "Jane Doe",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}
```
**Response**: Full updated customer record (same structure as DB row)

---

## Database Schema
**No changes** - Uses existing `customers` and `jobs` tables:
- `customers`: All fields unchanged
- `jobs`: Existing fields used; filtered by `company` and `archived` status

---

## UI/UX Features

### Customers List Page (`/customers`)
1. **Collapsed Card** (default):
   - Company (title), Contact (subtitle)
   - Phone/Email as clickable chips
   - Active/Queued/Completed badges
   - Address snippet
   - Chevron to expand, "View More" button
   - **Click card = expand** (buttons don't trigger)

2. **Expanded Card** (mini-dashboard):
   - **KPIs Row**: 6 tiles (active jobs, avg turnaround, on-time %, jobs this month, lifetime revenue, redo count)
   - **Work Mix**: Job type distribution + top 3 powders
   - **Recent Activity**: 5-row recent jobs table
   - **Actions**: "Create Job" (prefills customer), "View More"
   - **Lazy Loaded**: Dashboard data fetched on first expand only
   - **Smooth Animation**: Expand/collapse transitions

3. **Search**: Live client-side filtering (no page reload)
4. **New Customer**: Modal form (admin only)
5. **No CSV Export**: Hidden per spec

### Customer Profile Page (`/customers/<id>`)
1. **View/Locked Mode** (default):
   - All fields displayed as read-only text
   - Action bar: Back, Jobs Board, Edit, Email, Call
   - Sections: Essential Info, Address, Business Details, Recent Jobs
   - Sidebar: Quick Stats, Quick Actions, Contacts, Delete (admin)

2. **Edit Mode**:
   - "Edit" button toggles mode
   - Fields become inputs (text, textarea, etc.)
   - Save/Cancel buttons appear
   - Navigation guard: "You have unsaved changes..."
   - Save: PATCH request, no page reload, success toast
   - Cancel: Restores original values, exits edit mode

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Keyboard focusable (Tab navigation)
   - Enter/Space on cards toggles expand
   - ARIA labels on buttons
   - Focus-visible outlines

4. **Responsive**:
   - Desktop: 2-column layout (main + sidebar)
   - Mobile: Single column stack

---

## Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Dashboard data only fetched when card expanded
2. **Skeleton UI**: Immediate visual feedback while loading
3. **No N+1 Queries**: All KPIs aggregated in service layer
4. **Client-side Search**: No server round-trips for filtering
5. **Single PATCH**: Only changed fields sent on save

---

## Validation & Accessibility
✅ Cards are keyboard-focusable with visible focus states
✅ Enter/Space on focused card toggles expand
✅ "View More" is a real `<a>` tag
✅ ARIA labels/roles for KPI numbers
✅ Form validation in profile edit mode
✅ Navigation guard for unsaved changes
✅ Status badges use semantic colors

---

## Acceptance Criteria Status
✅ 1. Collapsed cards show company, contact, phone/email chips, badges (using GET /api/customers)
✅ 2. Expanding card fetches GET /api/customers/<id>/dashboard once; KPIs, Work Mix, 5-row table render; null metrics hidden
✅ 3. "View More" navigates to /customers/<id>
✅ 4. Profile opens locked; Edit enables fields; Save performs PATCH; success toast shown
✅ 5. Navigating away with dirty edits triggers confirmation
✅ 6. List page has no editable controls, no CSV export UI
✅ 7. Responsive: expanded card stacks to one column on small screens

---

## Configuration Notes
- **No environment/config changes needed**
- **Database**: Uses existing PostgreSQL connection (dev database)
- **Dependencies**: Tailwind CDN used (no npm install required)
- **Static Files**: Served from existing `/static` route

---

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Load `/customers` - should show customer cards
- [ ] Click card - should expand and show dashboard
- [ ] Click "View More" - should navigate to profile
- [ ] Profile: Click "Edit" - fields become editable
- [ ] Profile: Edit field, click "Save" - should save and show toast
- [ ] Profile: Edit field, click "Cancel" - should restore original
- [ ] Profile: Edit field, navigate away - should show confirmation
- [ ] Search customers - should filter in real-time
- [ ] New Customer (admin) - should open modal and save
- [ ] Keyboard navigation - Tab, Enter, Space should work

---

## Known Limitations
1. **Lifetime Revenue**: Not implemented (would require pricing/invoice data)
2. **Outstanding Balance**: Not implemented (would require accounting integration)
3. **Open Quotes**: Not implemented (would require quotes feature)
4. **Powder Parsing**: Simple parsing (brand/product_code not extracted from color field)
5. **Last Interaction**: Only shows customer updated_at (no user tracking)

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add sorting options to customer list
- Add filtering by status, region, etc.
- Implement revenue tracking
- Parse powder data more intelligently
- Add contact management UI to profile
- Add customer notes/timeline
- Export customer data (PDF, Excel)
- Bulk operations (delete, export)
