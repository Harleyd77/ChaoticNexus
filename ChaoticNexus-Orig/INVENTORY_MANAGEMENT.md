## Usage Guide

### Setting Up Inventory

1. **Initial Stock Entry**: For existing powders, update the `on_hand_kg` field with current stock levels
2. **Configure Thresholds**: Set appropriate low-stock thresholds (default: 5kg)
3. **Set Reorder Quantities**: Define how much to order when stock runs low

### Daily Operations

1. **Check Inventory Status**: Visit `/inventory` to see current stock levels
2. **Update Stock**: Use the Update button to record new stock levels after receiving shipments
3. **Adjust Stock**: Use the Adjust button for daily usage tracking
4. **Generate Reorder Lists**: Visit `/reorder` to see what needs to be ordered

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Update stock levels after each shipment received
2. **Usage Tracking**: Record powder usage for jobs to maintain accurate counts
3. **Supplier Management**: Keep supplier information up to date in reorder settings
4. **Audit Trail**: Always add notes when making significant stock changes

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Jobs System**: Track powder usage per job (future enhancement)
- **Customer Portal**: Allow customers to see powder availability (future enhancement)
- **Billing System**: Integrate with pricing for accurate cost tracking (future enhancement)

### Data Migration
If you have existing inventory data:
1. Import powder data with current stock levels in the `on_hand_kg` field
2. Set appropriate low-stock thresholds based on your usage patterns
3. Configure supplier information for automatic reordering

## Security & Permissions

- **Admin Only**: Stock updates and adjustments require admin privileges
- **View Access**: Regular users can view inventory status but cannot make changes
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged with user information and timestamps

## Future Enhancements

- **Barcode Scanning**: Mobile app integration for quick stock updates
- **Automated Alerts**: Email notifications for low stock levels
- **Supplier Integration**: Direct ordering through supplier APIs
- **Usage Analytics**: Track powder consumption patterns
- **Cost Analysis**: Detailed cost tracking and margin analysis
- **Multi-location Support**: Track inventory across multiple locations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Stock Levels Not Updating**: Check database permissions and ensure inventory_log table exists
2. **Reorder List Empty**: Verify low-stock thresholds are set correctly
3. **History Not Showing**: Ensure inventory_log table has proper indexes

### Database Maintenance

- **Archive Old History**: Consider archiving inventory_log entries older than 2 years
- **Optimize Performance**: Regular database maintenance for large inventory_log tables
- **Backup Strategy**: Include inventory data in regular database backups

## Support

For issues or questions about the inventory management system:
