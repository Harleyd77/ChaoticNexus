# DevTools Findings & Issues

**Purpose:** Track UI issues, console errors, and layout problems found during browser testing.  
**How to use:** Window 2 (Chrome DevTools MCP) documents findings here. Window 1 (SSH dev) fixes them and checks them off.

## Migration Progress Summary

### ✅ Completed Migrations

**Blueprints Created:**
- `auth` - Login/logout functionality with styled forms
- `customer_portal` - Customer-facing dashboard, job views, profile
- `customers` - Admin customer management
- `powders` - Powder inventory management  
- `inventory` - Stock tracking
- `intake` - Production and railing intake forms
- `sprayer` - Hit list and batch tracking
- `admin` - Users and settings management
- `dashboard` - Operations hub (already existed)
- `jobs` - Job management (already existed)

**Templates Migrated:** 30+ templates converted to new Tailwind/modern structure
- All pages now extend `_layouts/base.html`
- Consistent styling across all pages
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Dark theme optimized

**Routes Available:** All major routes now accessible (see list below)

### ⏳ Pending Work
- Repository layer (data persistence)
- Form submission handling
- JavaScript interactivity (search, filters, drag-and-drop)
- Full legacy template migration for complex pages (powders details, customers with JS)
- Integration with existing legacy auth/session management

## 🚨 URGENT ACTION ITEMS (2025-10-12)

- [x] Restart Docker container (2025-10-12 17:05 UTC) – `docker compose up -d web`
- [x] Install npm deps + build Tailwind bundle – `npm install && npm run build:servercss`
- [x] Verify dashboard after hard refresh – styling now matches Tailwind design

✅ Outcome: Flask now serves the compiled `app/static/css/app.css` (~75 KB), dashboard logo constrained to 56px height, metric cards render with proper Tailwind styling.

---

### 🔧 Issues to Fix

#### ✅ Accessibility - Login Form Autocomplete
**Page:** `http://10.0.0.196:8080/auth/login`  
**File:** `app/blueprints/auth/templates/auth/login.html`  
**Status:** Fixed - Added `autocomplete="username"`, `autocomplete="current-password"`, and `autocomplete="new-password"`

#### ✅ FIXED: Dashboard Logo Size Issue
**Page:** `http://10.0.0.196:8080/dashboard/`  
**File:** `app/blueprints/dashboard/templates/dashboard/index.html`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed (2025-10-12)  
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical

**Issue:**
- The Chaotic Nexus logo was rendering at **1,904 pixels tall** (measured via browser DevTools)
- Logo took up massive screen space, pushing actual dashboard content far down the page
- Users had to scroll extensively (5000+ pixels) before seeing any useful dashboard content
- Logo appeared in the welcome header section around line 53-59

**Fix Applied:**
- Added inline style constraint: `style="max-height: 56px; width: auto;"`
- This enforces the height even if Tailwind `h-14` class isn't working due to CSS not being compiled
- Changed in `app/blueprints/dashboard/templates/dashboard/index.html` line 59

**Verification Status:**
- ✅ Container rebuilt with fresh assets (`docker compose build web && docker compose up -d web`)
- ✅ Browser hard refresh shows logo constrained to 56px height

**Impact:** High - Dashboard header now usable without excessive scroll

#### ✅ FIXED: Dashboard Card Grid Layout
**Page:** `http://10.0.0.196:8080/dashboard/`  
**File:** `app/blueprints/dashboard/templates/dashboard/index.html`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed (2025-10-12)  
**Priority:** 🟢 Verified

**Issue:**
- Tailwind bundle was still the 76-byte placeholder; cards were unstyled plain text

**Fix Applied:**
- Ran `npm install && npm run build:servercss`
- Rebuilt and restarted container (`docker compose build web && docker compose up -d web`)

**Verification Status:**
- ✅ `app/static/css/app.css` now 75 KB inside container
- ✅ Dashboard shows Tailwind grid layout, borders, and shadows after hard refresh

#### ✅ FIXED: Light Theme Toggle
**Page:** `http://10.0.0.196:8080/dashboard/` (and all pages)
**File:** `app/templates/_layouts/base.html`, `app/static/js/theme.js`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed (2025-10-12)  
**Priority:** 🟢 Verified

**Issue:**
- Body used hardcoded `bg-slate-950` / `text-slate-100`, preventing light-theme tokens from taking effect.

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced body classes with theme-aware utilities: `bg-[var(--color-bg)] text-[var(--color-text)]`.
- Updated `theme.js` to sync CSS variables when toggling themes.
- Rebuilt Tailwind CSS (`npm run build:servercss`) and redeployed container (`docker compose build web && docker compose up -d web`).

**Verification Status:**
- ✅ Served HTML shows updated body class
- ✅ Theme toggle now switches between dark/light palettes without hardcoded overrides
